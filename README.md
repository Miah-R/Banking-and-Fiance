Data Structures used:
In our application we used a linked list because this best fits our individual tasks. It will be easier to insert and delete information we need. For one of our individual codes we needed to traverse a function and for another part we needed to declare a function. Using a linked list made it easy to declare a function because of string and using a linked list made it easy to traverse a function for our application to run.
